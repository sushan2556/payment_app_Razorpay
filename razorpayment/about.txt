Step 2: Get Razorpay Keys --

addign details under settings.py file 

RAZOR_KEY_ID = YOUR_KEY_ID
RAZOR_KEY_SECRET = YOUR_KEY_SECRET 

Step 3: Views.py
This is the main step of the process. First, we need to understand how payment works in Razorpay.
Create a Razor Order from our Django Server.
Pass Order Id and Other Options to the Frontend.
The user clicks the payment button and pays with one of the payment methods.
